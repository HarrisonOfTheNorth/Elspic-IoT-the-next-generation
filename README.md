# Elspic - *IoT's new Wonderwall*

The next generation of IoT is curiously *not* IoT but is an *evolution* of IoT *that has all of the abstractions of IoT* but is **bigger** than IoT.

So first, let's recap IoT.

*And let's be *simplistic* in our recap:*

- IoT is an 'internet' of Things;
- A connection of **Things** to the Internet;
- An 'Internet-of-Thing' device may connect to a local network, but never in it's lifetime actually surface to the internet ... but it's data *might*; and,
- Things that do not have such Internet or Intranet connectivity are not IoT.

Where the general definitions of IoT start to break down, is where connectivity and transmission occurs is a context that is not internet based, and yet data magically appears from a device, or to and subsequently on a device, that does not use any of the Internet's protocols - for example, HTTP, TCP, and others.

Examples of such **Non-IoT** devices are those that transmit and receive via Bluetooth or ZigBee, Short-Wave radio, or a mere serial port connection.

- Yet the proliferation of various such 'Non-IoT' but nevertheless *leading-edge* devices, lays it upon us to want to categorise all of them under a singular umbrella. 

Doing so will allow us to sub-categorize the science, and in doing so, extend ourselves into an 'IoT, the new generation' sort of wonderwall.

What's a wonderwall?

*Well, according to Gallagher, "Wonderwall" describes "an imaginary friend who's gonna come and save you from yourself".*

So how do we describe the greater domain of IoT that includes our usual understanding of interweb [sic] connectivity, as well as those whose connectivity is precluded from IoT terminology simply because they do not use Interweb connectivity? And ghere, of course, I'm using the word *Interweb* to describe IoT in the foregoing Internet and 'Intranet and prospectively Internet' context.

So let's promote all of our present IoT abstractions to a new level that incorporates IoT but also brings Non-IoT abstractions into the same family: let's express this wider domain of devices as being 'Electronically Conspicuous', **Elspic** for short!

This, of course, is the science of *Electronic Conspicuity*, and the advantage of using the adjective by saying that something is *eletronically conspicuous* is that it abstracts the science away from what the device is, to what the device does. Electronic Conspicuity is about the passage of information by any means, the device itself is just the means.
