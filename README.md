# Elspic - *IoT's new Wonderwall*

## PART ONE: INTRODUCTION

The reason why John and Jane Tech take care of dataflow, is so that George and Georgina User can be exposed to what's electronically conspicuous to them! *But what is this new science of Electronic Conspicuity, **Elspic** for short?* **And how is it an IOT Wonderwall?**

Yup, *wonderwall*. But what's a **wonderwall**?

Well, according to Gallagher, "Wonderwall" describes "an imaginary friend who's gonna come and save you from yourself".

You might not have even realised that IoT needs saving, but if something is going to save IoT, it's next generation is very curiously *not* going to be IoT, but instead be an *evolution of IoT outside of itself* **that has all of the abstractions of IoT** but is **bigger** than IoT - and poignantly - which releases all of the confined realms of IoT as though freeing all of the captive birds on earth so that they can freely fly into the sky. 

*We solution architects just love abstractions that free themselves!*

- By studying the abstraction of **Electronic Conspicuity**, we will; quickly discover that IOT needs saving from itself, *why* it needs saving from itself, and *how* Elspic is the solution.

### However first, let's recap IoT!

*And let's be *simplistic* in our recap:*

- IoT is an 'internet' of Things ...
- A connection of **Things** to the Internet ...
- An 'Internet-of-Thing' device may connect to a local network, but never in it's lifetime actually surface to the internet ... but it's data *might*, possibly, or probably, will ... and,
- We will refer to this vague and sometimes confusing relationship of 'Intranet to Internet' as *Interweb*, so that we can say that Things that do not have such Interweb connectivity are **not** IoT.
- Perhaps IoT is better called Interweb-of-Things.

### Elspic, The Emerging Science of Electronic Conspicuity

Quite paradoxically, this new emerging age of Electronic Conspicuity is causing data from even the smallest of circuit-boards, to magically appear on the otherside of the world despite not being an IoT device! The Interweb was not involved!

So where the general definitions of IoT start to break down, is where connectivity and transmission occurs is a context that is not Interweb based, and yet data magically appears from a device, or to and subsequently on a device, that does not use any of the Interweb's protocols - for example, HTTP, TCP, and others.

Examples of such **Non-IoT** devices are those that transmit and receive via Bluetooth or ZigBee, Short-Wave radio, terrestrial television even amateur radio and amatuer television, ... or even via a mere serial port connection. Even a device at the end of a Morse Code wire can be automatically controlled - as demonstrated by stock market tickertapes of years gone by - and yet that's obviously not IoT. And yet by the very the same token, there's other technology that is at the other end of the spectrum to Morse telegraph tickertapes that's modern, amazing, and yet is 'hidden under the IoT rock'.

- If it's not IoT and doesn't come up under an IoT search, it's hidden under a rock!

So the proliferation of various such 'Non-IoT' devices that are effectively hidden because they do not come up in an IoT search word result - but which are nevertheless *leading-edge* devices that warrant exposure to everyday John and Jane Tech - lays it upon us to want to categorise all of them under a singular umbrella so that we can accellerate the development of the collective science. The analogy here is that IoT is under a rock, but the broader science is not! Let's leave no stone unturned!

Doing so will allow us to sub-categorize the science, and in doing so, extend ourselves into an 'IoT, the new generation' sort of wonderwall.

So how do we describe the greater domain of IoT that includes our usual understanding of interweb [sic] connectivity, as well as those whose connectivity is precluded from IoT terminology simply because they do not use Interweb connectivity? 

The answer, of course, is to promote all of our present IoT **abstractions** to a new but higher level, and one that incorporates IoT but also brings Non-IoT abstractions into the same new family: let's express this wider domain of devices as being 'Electronically Conspicuous', **Elspic** for short!

### Let's Define the Science

Naturally, this is the science of *Electronic Conspicuity*, and the advantage of using the adjective by saying that something is *eletronically conspicuous* is that it abstracts the science away from what the device is, to prevail over the device using abstractions of what the device does. 

- Electronic Conspicuity is about the passage of information by any means, the device itself is **just** the means, and indeed, the device itself is not just expendable, the device is capable of being transparently replaced or superceded, without the user being aware that here was a fundamental change in the subsisting transport layer of the electronically conspicuous data: so long as the data flows, it does not really matter what the transport layer is that channels that data to it's destination, nor the device or devices that made such transport possible!

In the new age of Electronic Conspicuity, the focus is on the abstraction of the data that is exposed to the user, within the context of how the user wishes to use that data.

### Elspic Illustrated 

- A user receives data locally by Bluetooth, and what is significant here is that the data is electronically conspicuous to the user in the local context, *not* that the data was received by a technology called Bluetooth that only works locally. The data is radiated and received and is only electronically conspicuous in the local context.
- A device sends data to a user on the other side of the world via satellite, and what is significant here is that the data is electronically conspicuous to the user in a remote point-of-presence context, *not* that the data was sent using a satellite technology that has a remote point-of-presence. The data is radiated and received and is only electronically conspicuous to the end user at the remote point-of-presence.
- Information that is electronically conspicuous in the above examples are illustrated in an additional context where the data that is received is relayed further, whether a response from that relay is anticipated or not. The data is radiated and received and is electronically conspicuous in the global context, whether anonymously available, or available only by private subscription.

### Summary

John and Jane Tech will take care of making the data flow.

Because George and Georgina User really just care about what's electronically conspicuous to them! 

## PART 2: THE UNIFIED TRANSPORT LAYER

The THING about data that is electronically conspicuous - let's call this EoT, the 'Elspic-of-Things', or the 'Electronic Conspicuity-of-Things', is that data *that is observed as being electronically conspicuous* can be linear, tangental, or perpendicular.

- **Linear**: Data that is both electronically conspicuous and is linear, is merely one dimensional. A red light in the night, for example, is not capable of a transformation in itself. For example, a red LED that is electronically conspicuous simply says 'I am red', it does not say 'I am a red LED'; because it is linear, no work is done, the only message is 'I am red'; an illustration of lineality is that a linear notification that is red, does not, in itself, cause a response to the matter that it is indeed red, for example, because it is red, it does not cause the door to a recording studio to lock because a recording is underway; linear information is merely radiated and received so that *another system* may process the matter that it is red, if it wishes to do so.
- **Tangential**: Data that is both electronically conspicuous and is tangential, is best described as not being either linear, or perpendicular; tangential data *acknowledges* the receipt of electronically conspicuous data, but never-the-less does not transform the data; tangential data receives data that is electronically conspicuous and acknowledges that it has received the data; for example, a red light in the night is electronically conspicuous in that it is red, and the observer tell the red light that it sees it, or the observer would tell another observer that it has seen it. In this sense, the acknowledgement is electronically conspicuous in itself.
- **Perpendicular**: Data that is both electronically conspicuous and is perpendicular, is capable of transformation by an observer, and that transformation may be a simple data transform (for example, the data 'I see red' may transform to 'this [predefined] circumstance is true'), it may be a physical transform (for example 'I see red' may transofrm to 'The recording-studio door is locked'), it may be an elemental transform (for example, 'I see green' may transform to an electrolytic current being switched on that generates a certain gas as a result), however in any sense can be described as the response of an observer of electronically conspicuous data that causes work to be done.
