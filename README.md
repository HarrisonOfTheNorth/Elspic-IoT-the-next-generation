# Elspic - *IoT's new Wonderwall*

Yup, wonderwall. *But what's a wonderwall?*

Well, according to Gallagher, "Wonderwall" describes "an imaginary friend who's gonna come and save you from yourself".

You might not have even realised that IoT needs saving, but if something is going to save IoT, it's next generation is very curiously *not* going to be IoT, but instead be an *evolution of IoT outside of itself* **that has all of the abstractions of IoT** but is **bigger** than IoT - and poignantly - which releases all of the confined realms of IoT as though freeing all of the captive birds on earth so that they can freely fly into the sky. 

*We solution architects just love abstractions that free themselves!*

**However first, let's recap IoT!**

*And let's be *simplistic* in our recap:*

- IoT is an 'internet' of Things ...
- A connection of **Things** to the Internet ...
- An 'Internet-of-Thing' device may connect to a local network, but never in it's lifetime actually surface to the internet ... but it's data *might*, possibly, or probably, will ... and,
- We will refer to this vague and sometimes confusing relationship of 'Intranet to Internet' as *Interweb*, so that we can say that Things that do not have such Interweb connectivity are **not** IoT.
- Perhaps IoT is better called Interweb-of-Things.

And yet almost paradoxically, this new emerging age is causing data from even the smallest of circuit-boards, to magically appear on the otherside of the world despite not being an IoT device! The Interweb was not involved!

So where the general definitions of IoT start to break down, is where connectivity and transmission occurs is a context that is not Interweb based, and yet data magically appears from a device, or to and subsequently on a device, that does not use any of the Interweb's protocols - for example, HTTP, TCP, and others.

Examples of such **Non-IoT** devices are those that transmit and receive via Bluetooth or ZigBee, Short-Wave radio, terrestrial television even amateur radio and amatuer television, ... or even via a mere serial port connection. Even a device at the end of a Morse Code wire can be automatically controlled, and yet that's not IoT. By the same token, there's other technology that is at the other end of the spectrum to the Morse telegraph that's modern, amazing, and yet is 'hidden under the IoT rock'.

- So the proliferation of various such 'Non-IoT' devices that are effectively hidden because they do not come up in an IoT search word result - but which are nevertheless *leading-edge* devices that warrant exposure to everyday John and Jane Tech - lays it upon us to want to categorise all of them under a singular umbrella so that we can accellerate the development of the collective science. The analogy here is that IoT is under a rock, but the broader science is not! Let's leave no stone unturned!

Doing so will allow us to sub-categorize the science, and in doing so, extend ourselves into an 'IoT, the new generation' sort of wonderwall.

So how do we describe the greater domain of IoT that includes our usual understanding of interweb [sic] connectivity, as well as those whose connectivity is precluded from IoT terminology simply because they do not use Interweb connectivity? 

The answer, of course, is to promote all of our present IoT **abstractions** to a new but higher level, and one that incorporates IoT but also brings Non-IoT abstractions into the same new family: let's express this wider domain of devices as being 'Electronically Conspicuous', **Elspic** for short!

Naturally, this is the science of *Electronic Conspicuity*, and the advantage of using the adjective by saying that something is *eletronically conspicuous* is that it abstracts the science away from what the device is, to prevail over the device using abstractions of what the device does. 

- Electronic Conspicuity is about the passage of information by any means, the device itself is **just** the means.
